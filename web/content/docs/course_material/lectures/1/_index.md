- Genie needs to be instructed precisely, otherwise it will not respond!

- It will precisely do, what you told it to do! If you meant something else and that was your problem.

- Genie only understand a language, which has no scope for confusion/ambiguity.

# Intro to C Programming

## Hello World! C Program
`main.c` file. Try it out at https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/ 
```c
// 1. This line is a comment that is ignored by compiler.

// 2. include standard library for input/output. Allows to print to shell
#include <stdio.h> 

// 3. execution start inside this **function** named main. 
int main() 
{ // start of main function

    // 4. prints to the shell
    printf("Hello, world\n");
    return 0; /* 5. returns integer 0 */

} // end of main function
```

## Running the Program

1. Run gcc compiler to get executable file `main`
```gcc main.c -o main```
2. Run the executable `main`
```./main```
