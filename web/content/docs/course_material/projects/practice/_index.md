# 🧠 C Mini Projects for Practice — Dynamic Memory, Structs, Enums & File I/O

These projects are designed to test and reinforce your understanding of:
- Dynamic Memory Allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`)
- Structs and Enums
- Pointers and Arrays
- File I/O (`fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, etc.)
- Modular Design and Debugging

Each project can typically be completed in **1–2 weeks** with good testing and documentation.

1. Add new people
2. Add friendships (bi-directional links)
3. Print network connections
4. Save / load network from file

### 💡 Example Run
```
Enter name: Alice
Enter name: Bob
Make friends? (Alice, Bob): y
Friendship created!
Alice’s friends: Bob
Bob’s friends: Alice
```

    ELECTRONICS,
    CLOTHING
} Category;

typedef struct {
    int id;
    char name[50];
    float price;
    Category type;
} Product;

typedef struct {
    Product *product;
    int quantity;
} CartItem;

typedef struct {
    int receipt_id;
    CartItem *items;
    int item_count;
    float total;
} Receipt;
```

### 💻 Features
1. Add products
2. Display catalog
3. Add to cart dynamically
4. Generate and print receipts
5. Save receipts to file

### 💾 Example Output
```
===== STORE MENU =====
1. Add product
2. Purchase
3. Print receipt
4. Exit

Product: Milk
Qty: 2
Total: 91.00
Receipt saved to receipts.txt
```

- File I/O for persistence
- Secure PIN check

### 🗂️ Example Structures

```c
typedef enum {
    DEPOSIT,
    WITHDRAWAL,
    BALANCE_CHECK
} TransactionType;

typedef struct {
    TransactionType type;
    float amount;
    char timestamp[30];
} Transaction;

typedef struct {
    int account_number;
    char name[50];
    int pin;
    float balance;
    Transaction* history;

### Project 9 - Fractals

Read about Fractals, Madelbrot Set and BMP image format:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal.  
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set 
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format 

Understand the code for generating a BMP image of Madelbrot Set Fractal here: [madelbrot](./madelbrot.c). There are also several exercises given in the comments, including modifying the code to generate the [Julia set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set), which you can try.  
 
Modularize the code, by splitting it into several files/folders and have a makefile.

## Project 10: Image editor

Learn about the [PPM image format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) and complete the exercises in the code: [image editor](./image_editor.c).

Also modularize the code by splitting it into headers, .c files, include, src folder and add makefile.
